```go

// here f with be the csv file we want to write in
func writeCsv(filePath string, data *[][]string) {
file, err := os.OpenFile(filePath, os.O_APPEND|os.O_WRONLY|os.O_CREATE, 0644) // os.O_TRUNC
if err != nil {
log.Fatalf("error occured while opening the file %s", err)
}
// close the file to prevent memory leak
defer file.Close()
csvWriter := csv.NewWriter(file)
for _, row := range *data {
_ = csvWriter.Write(row)
}
// to remove buffer from the memory
csvWriter.Flush()
}
	
```
The os.OpenFile() function in Go allows you to open a file with various options by specifying flags and file mode permissions. Here are the commonly used flags and their descriptions:

os.O_RDONLY: Open the file for reading only.
os.O_WRONLY: Open the file for writing only.
os.O_RDWR: Open the file for both reading and writing.
os.O_APPEND: Append data to the file instead of overwriting it.
os.O_CREATE: Create the file if it doesn't exist.
os.O_EXCL: Used with os.O_CREATE, ensures that the file is created exclusively, and an error is returned if the file already exists.
os.O_SYNC: Open the file for synchronous I/O operations, where data is written directly to the storage device.
os.O_TRUNC: Truncate the file when opening it. This discards any existing content.
You can combine these flags using the bitwise OR operator (|) to specify multiple options.
file, err := os.OpenFile("example.txt", os.O_WRONLY|os.O_CREATE|os.O_TRUNC, 0644)
